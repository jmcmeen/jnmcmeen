Hello! I am a software engineer, data scientist, and Instructor of Computer Science / AI at Western Governors University. My research focuses on applications of acoustic analysis and machine learning algorithms in ecological sciences.

My GitHub repositories are primarly focused on teaching, but I plan to share more reasearch soon.
